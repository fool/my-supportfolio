I enjoy talking and writing about problem solving, and have helped several friends bootstrap support programs in their startups.  I've also run user groups and organized dozens of tech events from workshops to unconferences, and frequently volunteer in an organizational role at conferences like BarCamp and Open Source Bridge.
<p>
I've presented a few times in front of an audience lately about topics relevant to the kind of work I enjoy doing.  Most of these appearances are catalogued on <a href=http://lanyrd.com/profile/gently-7036/>Lanyrd.com</a>, and the notes and slide decks are linked below.

I've written some and advised on many of our public-facing documentation articles.  Here's the crunchiest one I wrote: <a href=https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/reports/service-level-agreements/api-examples-sla-reports>API examples for SLA reports</a>.
<p>
I  occasionally <a href=http://blog.newrelic.com/author/chris-mccraw/>wrote for New Relic's company blog on technical or social themes.</a>
<p>
I sometimes write up tech notes for internal consumption.  <a href=statuspage.html>Here's an example I wrote about effective use of status pages for your service.</a>
<p>
I wrote a bit for <a href=http://jamasoftware.com/blog>the Jama company blog</a> about social and technical things.  There's not an easy way to link to all of my articles but you can search for my name.
