<h1>Chris "fool" McCraw's SupportFolio</h1>

<h2>I like to help.  Lots of people like lots of things, but here I show you how I like to help, so you can see if you think you like my style. Check out some examples of my work and the results it brings</h2>
<h4>In my own words</h4><b><a href=in_my_words.shtml>Some of my better responses to customer questions, in context</a></b>, from a community forum I helped out in while working at New Relic.
<h4>In my customers' words</h4>
Sometimes people bother to fill out those "was this support interaction useful?" surveys after a ticket closes.  <b><a href=in_their_words.shtml>Here are a few choice excerpts.</a></b>
<h4>In the world</h4>
I like to speak on support and giving good demos at conferences.  I also occasionally write technical documentation and blog posts for my company. <b><a href=presentations.shtml>I've catalogued some of this work here.</a></b>

<h4>Got a problem? Helping customers is my job and my #1 priority...but solving problems as part of a team goes far deeper than that:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Scaling a team alongside a growing company is one of the biggest challenges that a support organization can face.  I believe strongly in mentorship as a teaching tool.  It can be challenging to apply in small doses, but I wrote up one way I started doing it on my team as the only senior tech support engineer - which was adopted by the rest of the senior staff as they were promoted: <b><a href=peer_reviews.html>The art of constructive peer reviews</a></b>
<li>I've developed or led many initiatives to improve workflow, such as:
	<ul>
	<li><b><a href=bestpractices.html>best practices for answering tickets</a></b>.</li>
	</ul>
<li>Inter- and Intra- teambuilding.  For instance, <b><a href=liaison.html>how to be an effective liaison to other teams within the company</a></b>.
<li>helping the organization grow
	<ul>
	<li>Representing the customer point of view to other teams like Development, Ops, Security, Product Management, and Sales.  I've written up some <b><a href=bug_escalation.html>guidelines for gentle but effective bug escalation</a></b> and I gave a talk on this general pattern in 2016: <a href=beyond.html>Working Across the Company</a>.
	<li>Team growth - I presented a DIY philosophy that costs $0 and creates new leaders and leads to promotion from within in 2016: <b><a href=garden.html>Growing your Team: A Garden Philosophy</a></b>.
	<li>Providing internal support - helping new hires inside and outside of support find information and understanding existing organizational structure and processes.
	</ul>
<li>compassion...
	<ul>
	<li>...for peers: I help onboard every new tech support employee at New Relic and most developers too - with training and/or pairing, I softened their landing at a new place with a dizzying array of technologies.
	<li>...and for customers: Between applying my domain expertise from a 20-year tech career and an understanding of the shortcomings of our solutions, I strive to make the customer feel like part of a family rather than like someone we're just using for their money.  In this vein my <b><a href=boothbabe_notes.html>talk on giving good demos</a></b> has some useful thoughts.
	</ul>
